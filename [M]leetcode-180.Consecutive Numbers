1.Select DISTINCT l1.Num  as ConsecutiveNums from Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3 
where l1.Id=l2.Id-1 and l2.Id=l3.Id-1 
and l1.Num=l2.Num and l2.Num=l3.Num

#for this solution, if there has a gap in id, then this solution wont work. but the question is not rigorous, the pre-condition is that the id is also consecutive!

2.select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
from Logs
where (Id + 1, Num) in (select * from Logs) and (Id + 2, Num) in (select * from Logs)
