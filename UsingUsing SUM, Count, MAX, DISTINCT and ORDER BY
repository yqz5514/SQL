UsingUsing SUM, Count, MAX, DISTINCT and ORDER BY

#Aggregates
The functions SUM, COUNT, MAX and AVG are "aggregates", each may be applied to a numeric attribute resulting in a single row being returned by the query. (These functions are even more useful when used with the GROUP BY clause.)

#Distinct
By default the result of a SELECT may contain duplicate rows. We can remove these duplicates using the DISTINCT key word.

#Order by
ORDER BY permits us to see the result of a SELECT in any particular order. We may indicate ASC or DESC for ascending (smallest first, largest last) or descending order.


1. The total population and GDP of Europe.
--------->SELECT SUM(population), SUM(gdp)
  	  FROM bbc
  	  WHERE region = 'Europe'

2.What are the regions?

---------->SELECT DISTINCT region FROM bbc

3.Show the name and population for each country with a population of more than 100000000. Show countries in descending order of population.

----------->SELECT name, population
  FROM bbc
  WHERE population > 100000000
  ORDER BY population DESC
