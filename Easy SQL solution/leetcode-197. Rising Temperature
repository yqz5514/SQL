self join

SELECT w2.Id  FROM Weather w1,Weather w2 
WHERE w2.Date = DATE_ADD(w1.Date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) 
AND w2.Temperature > w1.Temperature;

EXPLANATION:

TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE) return the number of days between from year 0 to date DATE
TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1 check if wt2.DATE is yesterday respect to wt1.DATE

We select from the joined tables the rows that have

wt1.Temperature > wt2.Temperature

and difference between dates in days of 1 (yesterday):

TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1;
