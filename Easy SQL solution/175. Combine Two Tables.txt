 solution:
select FirstName, LastName, City, State from person
left join address on person.PersonId = address.PersonId

the question is ask for sepcific information from table without address information. so left join is more capable. 


faster one:
SELECT tb1.FirstName, tb1.LastName, tb2.City, tb2.State
FROM Person AS tb1
LEFT JOIN Address AS tb2 
ON tb1.PersonId = tb2.PersonId
