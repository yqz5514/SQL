solution 1:
select 
ifnull((select round(count(distinct requester_id,accepter_id)/count(distinct sender_id, send_to_id),2)
from request_accepted, friend_request),0)
as accept_rate


solution 2:
SELECT
ROUND(
    IFNULL(
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id FROM RequestAccepted) AS A)
    /
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id FROM FriendRequest) AS B),
    0)
, 2) AS accept_rate;
