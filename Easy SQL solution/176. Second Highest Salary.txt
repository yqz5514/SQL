solution1:
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
from Employee
where salary < (select max(salary) from Employee)



# Using max() will return a NULL if the value doesn't exist. 
So there is no need to UNION a NULL. 
Of course, if the second highest value is guaranteed to exist, using LIMIT 1,1 will be the best answer.



other questions:
1. what if there are two same value of second highest salary?
2. or there has two same max(salary) in the table? will that effect this code?
maybe use distinct function?


alternative solutions:
1. SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
# this will help to pick a distinct highest value from table

2. SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
# deal with null without using max() function.
