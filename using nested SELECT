using nested SELECT:
	1. Using SELECT in SELECT. List each ocuntry in the same continent as 'Brazil'
		-------->SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent = 
				(SELECT continent 
				FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil')
	  1)Alias:
		Some versions of SQL insist that you give the subquery an alias. Simply put AS somename after the closing bracket:

		------>SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent = 
  			(SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Brazil') AS brazil_continent
	  2)Multiple Results:
		The subquery may return more than one result - if this happens the query above will fail as you are testing one value against more than one value. It is safer to use IN to cope with this possibility.

		The phrase (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil' OR name='Mexico') will return two values ('North America' and 'South America'). You should use:

		------->SELECT name, continent FROM world
			WHERE continent IN
 			(SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Brazil'
                                 OR name='Mexico')

	2. List each country and its continent in the same continent as 'Brazil' or 'Mexico'.
	--------->SELECT name, continent FROM world
			WHERE continent IN
  			(SELECT continent 
     			FROM world WHERE name='Brazil'
                   	OR name='Mexico')
	3.Subquery on the SELECT line: If you are certain that only one value will be returned you can use that query on the SELECT line.
          
	  Show the population of China as a multiple of the population of the United Kingdom

		----->SELECT
 			population/(SELECT population FROM world
             		WHERE name='United Kingdom')
  			FROM world
			WHERE name = 'China'
	4. Operators over a set
		These operators are binary - they normally take two parameters:
		=     equals
		>     greater than
		<     less than
		>=    greater or equal
		<=    less or equal
	You can use the words ALL or ANY where the right side of the operator might have multiple values.

	Show each country that has a population greater than the population of ALL countries in Europe.

	Note that we mean greater than every single country in Europe; not the combined population of Europe.
	--------->SELELCT name FROM world
			WHERE population > ALL
				(SELECT population FROM world
					WHERE continent = 'Europe'
