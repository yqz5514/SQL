select name, sum(rest) as rest, sum(paid) as paid, sum(canceled) as canceled, sum(refunded) as refunded
from product join invoice on product.product_id = invoice.product_id
group by product.product_id
order by product.name

--------------------------------------------
other solution:
select
p.name name,
sum(coalesce(i.rest,0)) rest,
sum(coalesce(i.paid,0)) paid,
sum(coalesce(i.canceled,0)) canceled,
sum(coalesce(i.refunded,0)) refunded
from product p
left join invoice i
on p.product_id = i.product_id
group by p.name
order by p.name
**Should we not be including all the products, irrespective of it having an invoice or not?
There can be products with zero transactions. Since the question said 'ALL products' 
I thought we'll have to do a LEFT join but looks like it only accept the answers for 
products that have an invoice number.**

这个更严谨，考虑得更多。逻辑
包含了查null， 确保只处理invoice里只match product table里的数据。
