Q:Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.


select employee_id, if(employee_id%2=1 and name not like'M%', salary,0) as bonus
from Employees;

!!!:  "colum%2=1" == odd
----------------------------------

select employee_id, (case when name like 'M%' then salary*0
                          when mod(employee_id,2) = 0 then salary*0
                          else salary*1 end) as bonus
from employees
order by employee_id


!!!: mod() ==> reminder
