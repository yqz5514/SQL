175. Combine Two Tables

--------my solution--------
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId

Cause the question said regardless someone has address or not, 
which means the address might be empty. 
In such case if you use full outer join, all information will be combined together,
and if use inner join, the empty value will be ignored. So left join is the best choice.


-------fastest solution-----------
SELECT tb1.FirstName, tb1.LastName, tb2.City, tb2.State
FROM Person AS tb1
LEFT JOIN Address AS tb2 
ON tb1.PersonId = tb2.PersonId
