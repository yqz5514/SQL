175. Combine Two Tables

--------my solution--------
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId

Cause the question said regardless someone has address or not, 
which means the address might be empty. 
In such case if you use full outer join, all information will be combined together,
and if use inner join, the empty value will be ignored. So left join is the best choice.
