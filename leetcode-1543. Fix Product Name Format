question: Write an SQL query to report

product_name in lowercase without leading or trailing white spaces.
sale_date in the format ('YYYY-MM').
total the number of times the product was sold in this month.
Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending order. In case of a tie, order it by sale_date in ascending order.


solution: 
SELECT LOWER(TRIM(product_name)) product_name, DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, "%Y-%m") sale_date, count(sale_id) total
FROM sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2

------------------------------------------------


in this table, sales_id is ptimary key, so no duplicate.

why use 1,2? : group by product_name, sale_date will refer to "two columns" in sales table.
But what you want to group is actually
GROUP BY LOWER(TRIM(product_name)) , DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, "%Y-%m")
, which is group by 1,2
