---------------
ctr = clicked/(clicked+viewed)

here we assigned action as 1 when clicked, 0 when viewed, NULL when neither. You need to notice that NULL doesn't count when calculate avg.

So:
AVG(******) = (clicked_count *1 + viewed_count *0) / (clicked_count + viewed_count)
= clicked_count / (clicked_count + viewed_count)
= ctr
