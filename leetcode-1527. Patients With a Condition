SELECT * FROM PATIENTS WHERE
CONDITIONS LIKE '% DIAB1%' OR
CONDITIONS LIKE 'DIAB1%'
----------------------------------------------------
The 2 conditions are both necessary! Imagine they have a code for "Prediabetes" which happens to be 'PREDIAB100'. Then the expression '%DIAB1%' will include.

Leetcode should make a test case for that.
