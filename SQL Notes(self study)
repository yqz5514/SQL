2.JOIN 
  1). inner join:The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
  2). left join:The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.
  3). right join: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.
  4). full : The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
