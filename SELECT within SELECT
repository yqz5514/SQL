1. BIgger than Russia
   List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'

   world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)

	---->SELECT name FROM world
		WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Russia')

2. Richer than UK
   Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.

	----->SELECT name FROM world
		WHERE continent = 'Europe' 
		AND gdp/population > (select gdp/population FROM world WHERE name = 'United Kingdom')

3.Neighbours of Argentina and Australia
  List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.

	------>SELECT name, continent
		FROM world
		WHERE continent IN (
		SELECT continent FROM world
		WHERE name IN ('Argentina', 'Australia')
		)

4.Between Canada and Poland
  Which country has a population that is more than Canada but less than Poland? Show the name and the population.

  -----> SELECT name, population 
	FROM world 
	WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Canada')
	AND population < (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Poland')

5. Percentages of Germany
Germany (population 80 million) has the largest population of the countries in Europe. Austria (population 8.5 million) has 11% of the population of Germany.

Show the name and the population of each country in Europe. Show the population as a percentage of the population of Germany.

The format should be Name, Percentage:

name	percentage
Albania	3%
Andorra	0%
Austria	11%
...	...
*Decimal places
You can use the function ROUND to remove the decimal places.
*Percent symbol %
You can use the function CONCAT to add the percentage symbol.

----->SELECT name, CONCAT(CAST(ROUND(population*100/(SELECT population FROM world 
                                           WHERE name = 'Germany'),0)AS INT)
             ,'%')
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'

****We can use the word ALL to allow >= or > or < or <=to act over a list. For example, you can find the largest country in the world, by population with this query:

----->SELECT name
  FROM world
 WHERE population >= ALL(SELECT population
                           FROM world
                          WHERE population>0)
You need the condition population>0 in the sub-query as some countries have null for population.

6. Bigger than every country in Europe

   Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)

-------->solution1:SELECT name FROM world
	 WHERE gdp > ALL(SELECT gdp FROM world
                        WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND
                        gdp > 0)
--------->solution2:SELECT name FROM world
	 WHERE gdp > (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM world
                        WHERE continent = 'Europe'
      			)

7. Largest in each continent

   Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

------>SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
       WHERE area > (SELLECT MAX(area) FROM world y
			WHERE x.continent = y.continent)

8. First country of each continent (alphabetically)
   List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
-------->SELECT continent, name
         FROM world x
         WHERE name <= ALL(SELECT name 
                           FROM world y
                           WHERE x.continent = y.continent)

9. Difficult Questions That Utilize Techniques Not Covered In Prior Sections

   Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
--------->SELECT name,continent, population /* the order of these selected varibles willl effect the arrangement of chart for the final result*/ 
		FROM world
		WHERE continent IN( SELECT continent FROM world x
                    			WHERE 25000000 > ALL(SELECT population FROM world y
                                         			WHERE x.continent = y.continent))

10.Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.
--------------->SELECT name, continent
		FROM world x
		WHERE population > ALL(SELECT population*3 FROM world y
                          WHERE x.continent = y.continent
                          AND x.name != y.name)
