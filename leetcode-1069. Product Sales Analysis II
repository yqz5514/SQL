the product table is actually required if the tests were to be implemented correctly , the question is worded in such a way that we should be displaying products with no sales in which case something like this would be the real solution

select
    product_id,
    IFNULL(sum(quantity), 0) total_quantity
from product left join sales
using(product_id)
group by product_id

-----------------------------------------------------
my soution: 
select product_id, sum(quantity) as total_quantity
from sales
group by product_id
